Hello, my name is Anais and I combined my love for dentistry with a self taught skill of coding. 
Using Python on Google Colab, I created a simple code that serves as a calculator to test the risks of getting a cavity.
I also coded an interactive button which gives information about the factors of getting cavities.


Open the notebook in Google Colab and Run all cells from top to bottom.
